This application is live at: https://whitepear.github.io/projects/frontend/pomodoro/app/index.html

Javascript implementation of a two-phase timer, inspired by the Pomodoro Technique. Users can set both work and break session-lengths in minutes. The timer will automatically and indefinitely cycle between both phases upon phase completion.

The timer can be paused and reset after it has been started, and a sound will play when a phase completes. The time that has elapsed within a session is shown on-screen both numerically and graphically, and the total number of completed work-break cycles is tracked. This application is responsively-designed.
